# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from Scratch

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Python. It includes cosine similarity calculations to find the most relevant document from a corpus based on a user query and integrates with a local LLM (e.g., LLAMA2) for generating responses.

## Overview

This project implements a basic RAG pipeline:
1. A corpus of documents is stored.
2. A user query is compared with the corpus using cosine similarity.
3. The most relevant document is retrieved.
4. The retrieved document and user query are passed to a local LLM for generating a response.

## Features

- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates the similarity between the user query and documents in the corpus.
- **Document Retrieval**: Identifies the most relevant document from the corpus.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses a local LLM (e.g., LLAMA2) to generate responses based on the retrieved document.
- **Customizable Corpus**: Easily update the corpus with new documents.
